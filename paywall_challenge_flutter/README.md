## Getting Started

This app has my own mindset 'Be a human building software for humans' and not only a machine that writes code seeing something in Figma. No, we are here to do more than programming, for example I slowed down the velocity of the listview animation, because users can't read or see what's happening in a proper way. You'll see many details like this in the challenge.

I hope you enjoy to review it!
